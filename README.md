‚ù§Ô∏è Product Favorite Feature (English Description):
I have developed a product section in a web application where each product includes a heart icon. Using this icon, users can add their favorite products to a Favorites List.

1. When a user clicks the heart button, the selected product is added to the Favorites List, the heart icon turns red, and the button becomes disabled to prevent the same product from being added multiple times.

2. Users can also remove products from the Favorites List.

3. When a product is removed from the Favorites, the heart button becomes active again, allowing users to favorite it once more if they choose.

This feature enhances the user experience by helping users easily track and manage their favorite products.
